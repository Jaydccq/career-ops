# Career-Ops Dashboard

A local dashboard for browsing reports, tracker, pipeline, and scan history.
It is served from this repository so Apply Next actions can reuse the local
Node/Playwright PDF generators.

## Usage

```bash
npm run dashboard       # start local dashboard server
bun run dashboard       # same script through Bun
bun run dashborad       # typo-compatible alias
```

Then open the printed local URL, usually `http://127.0.0.1:47329/`.

## What it shows

| Tab           | Source                       | Features                                   |
|---------------|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Apply Next    | `data/applications.md` + `reports/*.md` | Priority shortlist, selective shortlist, local completion marks |
| Reports       | `reports/*.md`               | Filter, select, render Markdown in panel   |
| Tracker       | `data/applications.md` + `reports/*.md` + `data/gmail-signals.jsonl` | Pipeline cards, active/attention counts, top opportunities, Gmail-only rows, email evidence, full-evaluation queue button |
| Pipeline      | `data/pipeline.md`           | Filter, done/pending toggle                |
| Scan History  | `data/scan-history.tsv`      | Filter, portal dropdown, sortable columns  |
| Keywords      | `data/newgrad-skill-stats.json` | Last-scan and profile matched/missed skill coverage |

## How it works

1. `dashboard-server.mjs` serves `template.html` with fresh data from the repo.
2. `build-dashboard.mjs` provides the shared parser/renderer for tracker,
   reports, pipeline, scan history, and keyword stats.
3. Apply Next PDF buttons call the local server, which reuses
   `generate-pdf.mjs` and `generate-cover-letter.mjs`, creates PDFs under
   `output/`, and copies them into `~/Downloads` when the download button is
   clicked.
4. Tracker rows read quick-screen decisions from report metadata such as
   `**Decision:** manual_review`. `manual_review` rows show a **Full Eval**
   button when the local dashboard server is running. The button queues a
   default bridge evaluation, so `npm run ext:bridge` must also be running.
5. Gmail signals are optional derived facts from read-only mailbox review. If
   `data/gmail-signals.jsonl` exists, Tracker matches records by
   `applicationNum` or exact company+role. Unmatched signals render as
   Gmail-only rows so companies discovered from the inbox still appear in the
   pipeline. Expanded rows show short email evidence, not full raw bodies.
6. Every local dashboard start runs `scripts/refresh-gmail-signals.mjs` once
   before serving the page. The script records its result in the gitignored
   `data/gmail-refresh-status.json`.

For a connector-assisted mailbox scan, run `/career-ops gmail-scan` inside
Codex.

For automatic local Gmail API refreshes, create a Google Cloud OAuth client
with Application type `Desktop app`, save it as
`config/gmail-oauth-credentials.json`, and run:

```bash
bun run gmail:auth
bun run gmail:scan
```

Do not use a Google OAuth `Web application` client for this local scanner. The
auth flow uses a random `127.0.0.1` callback port; Web clients commonly fail
with `redirect_uri_mismatch`.

The same Google Cloud project must have Gmail API enabled. If the scan reports
that Gmail API has not been used or is disabled, enable Gmail API in that
project, wait for propagation, then run `bun run gmail:scan` again.

After `gmail:auth`, every `bun run dashboard` startup attempts a fresh Gmail API
scan through `scripts/gmail-oauth-refresh.mjs`. To override the scanner command:

```bash
CAREER_OPS_GMAIL_REFRESH_COMMAND='["node","scripts/gmail-oauth-refresh.mjs"]' bun run dashboard
```

Use `CAREER_OPS_DASHBOARD_REFRESH_GMAIL=0 bun run dashboard` to skip the hook.

The `Apply Next` tab also stores a local completion marker in browser
`localStorage`. That marker is a dashboard convenience only; canonical tracker
state still lives in `data/applications.md`.

Report Markdown is rendered client-side with [marked](https://marked.js.org/)
and sanitised through [DOMPurify](https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify).

## Static Export

To write a standalone `web/index.html` snapshot:

```bash
npm run dashboard:build
```

Static export intentionally omits local profile email and Gmail signal data.
Run `npm run dashboard` for the private, fully enriched local view.

Run it after:

- new evaluation reports (reports/*.md)
- `node merge-tracker.mjs` runs (applications.md updates)
- scanner runs (scan-history.tsv updates)

The static snapshot can still browse embedded data, but PDF generation requires
the local dashboard server. Full-evaluation queueing also requires the local
dashboard server plus the bridge.

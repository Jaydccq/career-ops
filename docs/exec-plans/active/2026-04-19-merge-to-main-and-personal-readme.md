# Merge to main and personalize README

## Background

The `jd-extension-work` branch has been tested and pushed to `origin/jd-extension-work`. The user asked to merge it directly into their own `main` branch without opening a PR, and to rewrite the root README as a personal fork README.

## Goal

Merge `jd-extension-work` into local `main`, replace the upstream-style README with a concise owner-specific README, verify the result, and push directly to `origin/main`.

## Scope

- Preserve local untracked/runtime artifacts before merging.
- Merge `jd-extension-work` into `main` without creating a PR.
- Rewrite only the root `README.md` for the user's fork.
- Run relevant verification.
- Commit the merge and README update together, then push `origin/main`.

## Assumptions

- "My own main branch" means the fork remote branch `origin/main`, not `upstream/main`.
- The README should be a concise map for this fork, not an upstream marketing page.
- Private data files remain gitignored and should not be exposed in README.
- Existing duplicate warnings from `npm run verify` are acceptable if there are no errors.

## Implementation Steps

1. Confirm branch and remote state.
   Verify: `git branch -vv`, `git status --short --branch`.
2. Preserve untracked runtime artifacts.
   Verify: `git stash list` contains the safety stash.
3. Merge `jd-extension-work` into `main`.
   Verify: merge exits without unresolved conflicts.
4. Rewrite root `README.md`.
   Verify: README is concise, personal to the fork, and links to detailed docs.
5. Run verification.
   Verify: `git diff --check`, `npm run verify`, and extension/web smoke checks as needed.
6. Commit and push directly to `origin/main`.
   Verify: `git status --short --branch` is clean and `origin/main` points at the new commit.

## Verification Approach

- Use repository verifier for pipeline, bridge, and extension checks.
- Use `git diff --check` for whitespace.
- Run README-focused sanity checks by reading the rendered source shape and line count.

## Progress Log

- 2026-04-19: Confirmed `main` tracks `origin/main` and `jd-extension-work` is the tested feature branch.
- 2026-04-19: Saved local untracked/runtime artifacts in `stash@{0}` with message `pre-main-merge-untracked-runtime-artifacts`.
- 2026-04-19: Merged `jd-extension-work` into `main` with conflicts in `.claude/skills/career-ops/SKILL.md`, `README.md`, `modes/auto-pipeline.md`, and `package.json`.
- 2026-04-19: Resolved non-README conflicts by keeping the tested feature-branch behavior, including explicit cover-letter confirmation and extension/bridge scripts.
- 2026-04-19: Rewrote `README.md` as a concise personal fork map.
- 2026-04-19: Ran `git diff --check`, `npm run verify`, `npm --prefix extension run build`, and `npm run dashboard`.

## Key Decisions

- Directly target `origin/main`; no PR will be created.
- Keep README under the top-level-map constraint and move details to existing docs.

## Risks and Blockers

- Merge may conflict because `main` is behind the tested feature branch and upstream merge history.
- Reapplying the safety stash after merge may conflict with now-tracked files; leave it stashed unless the user asks to restore.
- `npm run verify` still reports the existing duplicate warnings for PayPal, Vast.ai, and Anduril, but reports 0 errors.

## Final Outcome

Merged `jd-extension-work` into `main`, replaced the root README with a personal fork README, regenerated `web/index.html`, and prepared the verified result for direct push to `origin/main` without opening a PR.
